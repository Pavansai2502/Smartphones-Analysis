# 📊 Smartphone Price Analysis

A beginner-level data analysis project focused on understanding how smartphone specifications influence market pricing. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and insights, all done using Python and common data science libraries.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to explore a dataset of smartphones to identify how different features—such as RAM, screen size, processor speed, battery capacity, and camera quality—affect smartphone prices. This project was designed to build hands-on skills in:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization and storytelling
- Drawing insights from real-world datasets

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
- Seaborn & Matplotlib for visualizations

---

## 📊 Key Visualizations

- RAM vs Price  
- Processor Speed vs Price  
- Screen Size vs Price  
- Battery Capacity vs Price  
- Rear Camera Quality vs Price  

Each visualization helped identify how strongly a particular feature correlates with price tiers.

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Smartphones with **higher RAM and faster processors** are more likely to be priced higher.
- **Larger screens and better camera specs** moderately influence pricing.
- **Battery capacity** has less direct impact on price but aligns with mid-range models.
- Strong correlations were found between multiple specs and pricing, useful for feature prioritization in marketing and product development.

## ✅ Conclusion

This project helped solidify core data analysis skills:
- Working with real-world messy datasets
- Cleaning and transforming data using Pandas
- Telling visual data stories with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Summarizing technical findings into business-relevant insights

---
## 🚀 Next Steps

- Convert the analysis into an interactive dashboard (using Streamlit or Dash)
- Apply regression models to predict smartphone prices
- Analyze trends by brand or operating system
